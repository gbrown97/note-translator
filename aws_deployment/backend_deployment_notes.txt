        ~$ mkdir eb-note-translator-backend
        ~$ cd eb-note-translator-backend

    2. Create and activate a virtual environment named virt:
        ~$ virtualenv virt
        ~$ source virt/bin/activate

    3. Copy Note-Translator application files
        (virt) ~$ cp ../note-translator-backend/application.py .
        (virt) ~$ cp ../note-translator-backend/requirements.txt .

        (virt) ~$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt

    5. View the installed libraries with pip freeze:
        (virt) ~$ pip3 freeze

    6. Save the output from pip freeze to a file named requirements.txt
        (virt) ~$ pip3 freeze > requirements.txt

    7. Add .ebignore file in current directory if not exists

    8. Add "virt" to .ebignore

    9. Initialize your EB CLI repository with the eb init command:
        (virt) ~$ eb init -p python-3.7 flask-tutorial --region us-east-2
